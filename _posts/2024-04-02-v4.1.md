Parlatype is using Libadwaita now, has a new Preferences dialog and a theme selector which was ~~stolen~~ copied from GNOME Text Editor.

![Theme selector](/images/v4.1/asr-switch-to-asr.png)


A few regressions from v4.0 were fixed:
* F10 toggles primary menu
* Show value of playback speed
* Some leftovers (GObject introspection, python example)


# Changed dependencies

* New: libadwaita-1 (>= 1.4)
* Raised: GTK (>= 4.10)
* Raised: GLib (>= 2.70)


# Removed functionality

My time is limited, so in order to keep the project maintainable I had to remove a view bits and bytes. There is no support for Windows (aka win32) anymore. I have no hardware with this OS anymore and I don't want to test in a virtual machine. 

Support for Mozilla DeepSpeech has been removed as well, in this case because that project is not active anymore.
