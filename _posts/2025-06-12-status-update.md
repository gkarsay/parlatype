Let's face the truth: I don't spend the time necessary to keep this going. I can't and I don't want to.

Maybe there will be some sporadic efforts to prevent bit rot, maybe there will be some outbursts of productivity, but I have no hope for a sustainable future of this project.

I didn't achieve all the goals I wanted to, for sure I made some wrong decisions, but hey, I'm proud of having started it and having brought it so far.
