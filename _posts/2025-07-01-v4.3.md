Although I [declared this project as unmaintained](/2025/06/12/status-update) (or kind of) here it is, another release of Parlatype.

I haven't looked at the code for several months, now trying to finish the things I started back then.

Parlatype now supports current PocketSphinx 5 (option pocketsphinx=true) and still supports the old pre-alpha version (option pocketsphinx-legacy=true).

As a reminder, speech recognition works only with the LibreOffice extension but that's something I really can't support anymore. It's written in a different language that I'm not very fluent in and there are tons of obstacles when it comes to LibreOffice and its extension system.

This version brings an updated MPRIS interface that provides information about the album, author and title. There is a lot of small fixes in this version and modernizations under the hood -- all in all a rather boring release.
