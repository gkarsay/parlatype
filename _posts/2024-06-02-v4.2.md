This release of Parlatype and Parlatype LibreOffice Extension is triggered by the move to a new website, www.parlatype.xyz. Please update any bookmarks or references to www.parlatype.xyz.

Apart from the website also the app ID has changed (xyz.parlatype.Parlatype) and the DBUS interface name. Because of that previous versions of Parlatype LibreOffice Extension are incompatible with this version of Parlatype. The new, compatible extension is part of this release.
