I'm proud to present Parlatype 3.1 together with Parlatype LibreOffice Extension 3.1.1.

This is a minor release with bug fixes and a new feature: MPRIS control.


# Main changes

* Added an MPRIS interface.

* Switched to Weblate for translations.

* Fixed a bug, where setting the initial position failed in some cases. 



# Translations

I'm happy to be on Hosted Weblate now, which makes translation handling much easier.
