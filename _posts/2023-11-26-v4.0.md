Despite a delay of 18 months I'm proud to present Parlatype 4.0 together with Parlatype LibreOffice Extension 4.0. The main difference is the switch to GTK 4.

In the meantime there was a lot of fuzz about AI. Parlatype's automatic speech recognition is lagging more and more behind the current state of the art. In fact, I don't recommend it for automatic speech recognition anymore. To be honest I can't remember, if I ever did. In its current state it's best used for manual transcriptions or just as an audio player showing a waveform. Of course there's a faint hope to catch up a bit with AI development in the next releases.
