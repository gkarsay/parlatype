  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>Parlatype (that is libparlatype) is the core library for
  the Parlatype program, a basic audio player intended for speech transcription.
  The library is published separately as it might be useful for other applicatons
  as well.</para>

  <para>PtPlayer is the core GStreamer backend that can be used as an audio
  player. PtWaveviewer is a GtkWidget to show a wave form and uses PtWaveloader
  to extract the wave form from a given file.</para>

  <para>Parlatype is (kind of) stable. That means that the library is versioned,
  API changes are documented, however, it changes frequently.</para>

  <para>The versioning system is a bit confusing: It's coupled to releases of
  the Parlatype application and this way minor version releases can break the API.
  GObject Introspection however has an API version.</para>
